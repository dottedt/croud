What I would *really* like to see is Code Academy venture into the less privileged areas of Chicago as a group or as students.  Programming is a powerful tool than can meaningfully work to improve communities.  There are a lot of socio-economic problems, and programmers can help leverage limited resources to help tackle challenges for social good.   This only works if there is engagement where engagement is needed most acutely.

I'm from a really, really small farm town. How I ended up lusting over technology instead of John Deere tractors is beyond me, so I definitely didn't fit in with the majority... at all.

Carolyn opened my eyes to the world of ""Don't Make Me Think"" and I now cringe every time I experience a terrible user experience. I didn't fully realize how much I had learned until I worked with a team of developers and explained to them some of the concepts that I have been absorbing through the UX class.","I helped build Hashpage during the first hackathon, I worked with Team BeerOn for Demo Day and I am personally beginning work on my beer blog ""boztastesbeer"", co-founded a yoga clothing distributor YogaHarbor.com, and developing  AddHocUs.com","I plan to build on the base that I have started in Code Academy by working through courses on CodeSchool.com, Lynda.com, and Hartl's tutorial so that I can fully utilize the Fall Code Academy Dev Course. I also plan to continue on working with the many great people I have met through Code Academy in any way that I can to help them succeed.
